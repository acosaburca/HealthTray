Watch your healthchecks from the system tray - https://healthchecks.io

Poll checks for status and alert when they change. See all your checks and get an overall status at a glance.

This is my first ever WPF application and was created mostly as a learning experience.

Notable libraries used:
* [JSON.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
* [WPF NotifyIcon](http://www.hardcodet.net/wpf-notifyicon)
